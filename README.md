This tutorial is to help you succeed in SharePoint and also have fun learning SharePoint.I use this for training many professionals across the world.
The codes are from Microsoft, Contoso labs,  my own experiences and many many Sharepoint experts from the world.
I have tried to get the best and latest hands on for SharePoint On Premises and Online and focus is more on Online for now.

There are Demos, Games,Hands On,pictorial concepts, theory, and many videos incase you miss the classes.

All the best and take care.
